## Journals

Please keep all of your individual journals in this directory.

Each team member is required to keep a development journal, which should be a single markdown file with an entry for each day the project was worked on.

Recommended naming convention is `first_last.md`.

05/24/24

- We got our repository today and we started to get our intro to how to set up the website. We covered several topics such as how we will have share information.

05/28/24

- We decided to use postgreSQL as our database. We also practiced git flow, inlcuding issues to help stay organized.

05/29/24

- what did you work on the day before
	- we worked on git and git flow and started the user pathway
- what do we want to get done today?
	- figure out the remaining paths for our user and flushing out our database.
- what are out blockers?
	- blockers are time and understanding of what we are doing moving forward.

- We were not able to add a user pathway as we got so deep into the code issues that we ended up regressing to an earlier version of our project. We then were able to use our lecture from the day to then get sign up to work and got to a good place where we then saved for the day. We learned a lot about mob coding today and how to better handle this type of coding.


05/30/24

- what did you work on the day before?
	- we got our signup to function in fastAPI
-  what do we want to get done today?
	- finish out our functions for fastAPI, build both pool and user models
- what are out blockers?
	- talking over each other and overwhelming the person that is coding.

- We were able to get our signup function to work and then build out our sign in earlier in the day. We used the extra time to focus on other parts of the application including adding pools but were only able to make the pools but not see the list of pools.
