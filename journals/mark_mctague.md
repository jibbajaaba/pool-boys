Mob coded to add some attributes to User Models and Queries. Also made sure to get the docker yaml file working by creating the .env file.


### 5/29/24

Had to start project over due to issues with user models, sign in, out, authenticate.

### 5/30/24

Worked on finishing user and authentication. Got them working properly.  Also worked on db models and SQL code for db tables. Started working on creating a pool also. ended the day without getting it working but I worked on it after hours and figured out the problem. Kept getting a database error. was checking the code we did and made some corrections but main problem was models needed to be fixed, id for pools was not serialized and poolowner_id was not correctly matching up i believe. Will have to avoid doing this in the future though. Need to work with my team on these problems.
