Mob coded to add some attributes to User Models and Queries. Also made sure to get the docker yaml file working by creating the .env file.


### 5/29/24

Had to start project over due to issues with user models, sign in, out, authenticate.

### 5/30/24

Worked on finishing user and authentication. Got them working properly.  Also worked on db models and SQL code for db tables. Started working on creating a pool also. ended the day without getting it working but I worked on it after hours and figured out the problem. Kept getting a database error. was checking the code we did and made some corrections but main problem was models needed to be fixed, id for pools was not serialized and poolowner_id was not correctly matching up i believe. Will have to avoid doing this in the future though. Need to work with my team on these problems.

### 6/7/24

Worked on getting reservations completed and did some error catching. will be working on testing next class and looking to get redux setup over the weekend with the team.

### 6/21/24

worked on fixing more issues and testing the website. fixed things like making certain form inputs required and fixing errors. Did work on getting stuff together for te readme file also and hoping to get that done this weekend so come Monday is just about submitting the project and maybe planning additional features we want to implement or build out.
